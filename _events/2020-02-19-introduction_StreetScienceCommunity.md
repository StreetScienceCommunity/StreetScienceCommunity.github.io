On the 19th of February we introduced the [BeerDEcoded project]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}) and the Street Science Community to a scientific audience. The aim was to increase the publicity of our project and to attract scientists who are interested to join the project. At the beginning of a galaxy workshop we gave a 15 minutes talk followed by questions from the audience.
