On the 27th of September we tested a new DNA extraction protokoll for the [BeerDEcoded project]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}). Our intention was to symplify the yeast DNA extection steps, so it is more easy for not labaroty people to follwo the steps of the extraction protocoll. Initally the DNA isolation was performed by two crutal washing steps. Frist we did let the DNA bind to some beats and second a colum washing step was perfomed. In the new protocoll we do symplfiy this step by preparing the cells differnetly so we can only whash using alkohol to remove the DNA from other moleculs and unwanted substances. 
The extraction itself was performed by two not lab traint members (Florian and Teresa) of the street sience community with the guidence of our very helpfull lab expert Martina. 
We extracted the yeast DNA from 3 bottles of la trappe beer and the results where convincing enough to do the protocol change to the easyer and more understanable new one.
