The [Galaxy Community Conference](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019/) was held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July. And the Street Science Community participated to the event. 

During the first day of GCC, we demonstrated how to sequence the DNA of beer (["Beer Decoded, Here and Now!"](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/QZyL/beer-decoded-here-and-now)):
