On the 8th of Dezember, we held our a one day workshop of the [BeerDEcoded project]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}) for high school teachers in the Biology labratory of the universtey of Freiburg.
We did prepare already extraced DNA of a la trape beer sample for sequencing.  
The aim of the workshop was to get teacher intersted in our Workshops and establish contacts to high school. 
Therefore, at the end of the workshop we had a section where we dicussed possble cooperations. In the end we came up with a plan to split the workshop into several small 2h secsions, so that puples can do this as one biology teaching unit e.g. over one month.
