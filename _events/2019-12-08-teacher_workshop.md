On the 8th of December, we hold our one-day workshop of the [BeerDEcoded project]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}) for high school teachers in the biology labratory of the University of Freiburg.
We did prepare already extracted DNA of a beer sample for sequencing.
The aim of the workshop was to get teachers interested in our Workshops and establish contacts to high schools. 
At the end of the workshop we had a session where we dicussed possible cooperations. In the end we came up with a plan to split the workshop into several small 2h sessions, so that pupils can do this as one biology teaching unit e.g. over one month.
