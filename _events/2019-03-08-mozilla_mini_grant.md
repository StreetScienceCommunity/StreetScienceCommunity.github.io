Today, we are happy to announce that our project received a [Mozilla Science Mini Grant award](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/meet-mozillas-latest-open-science-awardees-cfa45348e5d5).

With this funding, we will be able to develop the [BeerDEcoded project]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}) to establish protocols for extracting, sequencing and analyzing yeast DNA from bottled beers in an accessible simplified fashion.
These protocols will be used to organize workshops in which students and other individuals come into contact with molecular biology, data analysis, and open science by extracting, sequencing and analyzing the "DNA of beer" more specifically brewing yeast.

The first public workshop will be held on the 31st of March.
