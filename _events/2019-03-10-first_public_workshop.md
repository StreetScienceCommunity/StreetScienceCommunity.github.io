On the 31st of March, we hold our first public workshop for the [BeerDEcoded project]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}) in Freiburg. Some students and external people participated to this event: 16 peoples in total, including us.

We started the day with short introduction to beer, yeast, DNA, but also lab safety. We organized after some games around pipetting and centrifuge to make the participants more comfortable with both.

We extracted DNA of the yeast of a local Black Forest beer, the not filtered Waldhaus.

The extraction went well. In parallel, we tried to sequence DNA extracted previously (from another local beer, Rothaus). But we encountered several problems during the library preparation and the sequencing: mistakes in the protocols, reuse of old flowcell, etc. We will improve the protocol to fix the issues.

We then analyzed the data using Galaxy.

The participants seem to have enjoyed the day!

## Feedbacks

At the end of the day, we collected some interesting feedbacks:

- Learn a little bit how experiments are conducted in a lab
- The lab work, really interesting
- The interactivity

*What could be improved?*
- Sequencing
- More structure in what is done

- Introduction: explain each new term in one sentence at 1st usage
- Try to always present why we are doing what in this moment

*Do you have any suggestions?*
- A sheet that describes all steps which are done (a summary without details)
- Explain the workflows using some charts or figure, illustrating each performed step
- Projector for talks (presentations)
- A step-by-step overview over the workshop parts

## How to make the next event better?

This workshop was our first public one. We learnt a lot during this day: what works but also what we need to improve.

We met few days after the event and come up with some ideas:
- Improving the library preparation protocols
- Create good introduction
- Create posters with the protocols
- Restructure the whole day with a more precise schedule
- Simplify the terms we use
- etc

We will implement them during the next months to be ready for our next workshop in July.
