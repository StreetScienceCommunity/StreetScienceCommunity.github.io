On the 27nd of Februaray we tested the new flongle nanopore flowcell to see if we can substitute the more accurate but also more expancive nanopore flowcell by the flongle. The second aim of our internal workshop was to test the new sequencing protocoll and see if member of the group, who did not performed the DNA sequencing until now could follow the protocol easily.
We could idenfy some week spots in the protocol. Which could have let to the low sequencing read result of this day. 
To roul out any issues of the sequenced probe or the newly used flogle we repeted the sequencing with more experince people. Both experence helpt us in a indept analysis to impove not only the protocol but also idenfy operational issues which a not lab trained person could face.
