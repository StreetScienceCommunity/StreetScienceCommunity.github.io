# Learn in an interactive game about DNA, beer, sequencing, and Galaxy.

## Our Vision
Scepticisms arises more and more because of false information and one-sided perspectives. Scientific advancements such as sequencing is often connote with distrust, and words like gene therapy or gene editing triggers in most people a surreal fear. We think that science is not accessible enough for citizens and we see a lack of a fun platform to learn about metagenomic data analysis. Thus we are currently developing the first citizen-reviewed game for a Galaxy instance.

## The Idea
We want to created a gaming parkour so people can dive into science and our project in a playful matter. They will learn about metagenomic data from the raw sequencing files to the interpretation of the data analysis. We will use Galaxy as a platform to teach about sequencing data, microbiota data analysis, and Galaxy itself.
