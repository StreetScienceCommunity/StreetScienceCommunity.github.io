In the Street Science community, we want to make science tangible & accessible
by bringing it to the "street" via open science workshops. These workshops are
an excuse to meet, discuss, educate, and develop ideas in a neutral, open,
noncompetitive and not-for-profit environment.

We are currently mostly organizing [**BeerDEcoded** workshops]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}), 
an immersion into biology, bioinformatics & sciences via beer and their yeasts.
