## What are we doing?

We are working with teachers, educators and citizens to educate the public about
open science and particularly with sequencing, data-analysis, molecular biology,
their benefits and implications.

## The problem

At a time when so many decisions are being made on the basis of science, it is
becoming increasingly important to inform the public about the issues at stake.
Popularization of science is then important to educate the public about the
benefits and implications of the scientific news. It is particularly true for
the biotechnologies and DNA sequencing.

At a time where scientific advances happen faster then ever and new technologies
enter the market at a unprecedentedly speed, education and clarification becomes
a key factor to remove fears and sustain a open society. It is particularly true
for the field of biotechnology and molecular biology. Due to the rapid
development in this field, more and more citizens get into contact with these
techniques. For example personalized medicine, services like 23andMe or AI are
entering our daily life. We strive to shed light into scientific blackboxes by
facilitating hands-on experience and data analysis with ground-breaking
technologies to make the scientific process more tangible.

## The solution

The Street Science Community is a voluntary-based non-profit group that aims to
bring science to the public. We aim to organize workshops in which pupils,
students and citizens come into contact with molecular biology, data-analysis,
and open science by extracting, sequencing and analyzing of DNA.

Our main project, [BeerDEcoded]({% link _projects/beerdecoded.md %}), aims to
sensibilize the participants to molecular biology and genomic related research,
DNA sequencing and data analysis and the challenges and possibilities that
genomics brings to our society.

## Who are we?

We think that knowledge transfer from different domains is crucial for this
project hence Street Science Community consists of people with different
expertise and skills. Computational- and molecular biology researchers as well
as Bioinformaticians and we are all dealing with life-science problems on a
daily basis, but from different angles.

## Our values

We have high ethical standards, including:

- **Education**: Help educate the public about science and biotechnology, their
  benefits and implications
- **Transparency**: Emphasize transparency and the sharing of ideas, knowledge, data,
  protocols and results.
- **Open science**: Promote citizen science and decentralized access to science.
- **Modesty** Know you don't know everything.
- **Community**: Carefully listen to any concerns and questions and respond honestly
- **Respect**: Respect humans and all living systems.
- **Responsibility**: Recognize the complexity and dynamics of living systems and our
  responsibility towards them.

## What do we need?

**You!** In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in fundraising, science, education, communication, interaction
with the public. We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course.

## Get involved

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can)
or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're sure
you can) then please check out [our contributors'
guidelines]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
our [roadmap]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/roadmap.md).

Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and
supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us
we ask that you follow our [code of conduct]({{ site.github.repository_url
}}/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions both on and offline.
