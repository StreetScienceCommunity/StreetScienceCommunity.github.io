We're thrilled you choose to run a BeerDEcoded workshop.
We hope this guide will help you navigate the logistics of the workshop organization. If anything is unclear or you have more questions, feel free to add comments in this doc, or reach out to us directly. We're here to help!

# Goals, targets, and learning objectives

**Purpose**: make life-science tangible & accessible

**Outcome**: pupils, citizens aware about DNA, sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, open science and their applications and their impact on their daily life

**Process**: 1.5 day (or less according to modules) practical workshop on beer

**Targets**: pupils in high school (above 16 years old) and citizens with or without scientific background

**Learning objectives**: at the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- perform simple laboratory tasks
- give original examples of microbes and their diverse roles
- explain what is cell and what it contains
- describe DNA as the building block for life
- give examples of DNA sequencing technologies
- apply a pre-defined data analysis pipeline

# Pedagogical Material

- Free to (re)use if credits are given

Ready to use and modular protocols
- 2 versions
    - detailed and explanatory version for teachers
    - streamlined version for pupils
- Possibility to interrupt and split the protocols
- Ideas of small pedagogical games to help understanding the protocols
- List of required consumables and materials

Slides for introduction talks but also as support for all protocols
- Open questions to start discussions
- Notes for presenters
- Presentation material to introduce the topic, theoretical background for lab-work and bioinformatics, with notes for presenters
