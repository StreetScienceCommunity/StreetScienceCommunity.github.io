Need to change it probably

### Where can we find micro-organisms?

Make them vote for each image if there is micro-organisms

### And what about in humans?

The main view about micro-organisms in human

### And what about in humans?

But micro-organisms are mostly beneficial in humans

---

### Do we have more micro-organism cells or <br>human cells in our own body?

---

### Do we have more micro-organism cells or <br>human cells in our own body?

- **10 times** more micro-organism cells than human cells
- More than **10,000** different microbe species in one human

### What about beer?

### Key Ingredients of Beer

---
### 1. Brewing: Malting

![](/images/materials/introduction/brewing_2.svg)

---
### 2. Brewing: Mashing

![](/images/materials/introduction/brewing_3.svg)

---
### 3. Brewing: Boiling

---
### 4. Brewing: Fermentation

### How to identify micro-organisms?

![](/images/materials/introduction/timeline_1.png)

???

- Historically, cultivation
- only 10% can be cultivated

---

### More than 90% of micro-organisms are unculturable

![](/images/materials/introduction/unculturable.jpg)

---
### Any other solution?

- How can we compare micro-organisms?
- What do you have in common with any other living organisms?
- What does make you different from your neighbor?

---
### DNA the blueprint of life

![](/images/materials/introduction/all_live_DNA.svg)


???

- DNA is the common element between organisms.
- But how can you determine it's difference?

---

### What is DNA?

![](/images/materials/introduction/DNA_ATGC.svg)

???

- alphabets
- ATCG small moleculs
- consits of atoms
- Atoms are social
- How can we now read the DNA?

### Do you remember?

### DNA Sequencing

![](/images/materials/introduction/sanger_sequencing.svg)

.footnote[[Sources](https://lerninhalte.blogspot.com/2013/04/dna-sequenzierung-kettenabbruchmethode.html)]

???
- Sanger: Very accurate but not feasable whole genones!
Do you konw of any genome or sequencing projects?

---
### The Human genome project

![](/images/materials/introduction/timelineHGP_image2.jpg)

???
Huge development:
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or
High Throughput Sequencing (HTS)

---

### How much effort to sequence a human genome?
