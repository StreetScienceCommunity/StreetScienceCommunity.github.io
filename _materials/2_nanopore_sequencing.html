### Ingredients


- **Fragmentation Mix (FRA):** Ligases (Exonucleases) to cut DNA into shorter pieces. Will cut at certain sequences.
- **Rapid Sequencing Adapter (RAP):** Ligation of adapters to the DNA fragments (leader and hairpin adapter). The leader adapter will allow the DNA to dock to the nanopore. The hairpin adapter is then for the complement strand.
- **Flush Tether (FLT):** Guides the motorprotein to the pores.
- **Seqeuncing Buffer (SQB):** For the ionic current.
- **Flush Buffer (FB):** For washing.
- **Loading Beads (LB):** To increase the molecular weight of the DNA. Helps to suck the DNA from the loading port into the flowcell.
