## Protocol: Introduction

* How does beer get its unique taste?
  * The taste depends on the used ingredients and the processing.

* What are the raw ingredients of beer?
  * Water, Barley, Hops and Yeast (insert foamstabilizer joke here)

* What happens during processing?
  * The sugar from the barley is fermented by the yeast into alcohol. Yeast is small single cellular organism, a bazillion of is working together for the fermentation.

* How does the yeast influence the taste?
  * Depending on the type (species) of yeast not only a higher amount of alcohol can be produced but also different side-products that have a specific taste (e.g. Banana).

* What is different between the yeast types?
  * Each yeast type stores information on how to function in a long filamentous molecule known as DNA. This molecule is like a blueprint for important components of the yeast, including those that are used in fermentation.

* What is DNA made of?
  * DNA consists of 4 building blocks, that are chained one after another to form in yeast a over 10 milion blocks long filament. There is a second filament also made of the same building blocks that is sticking to the first filament.

* What are the building block of DNA?
  * There are for building blocks, represented by the letters A,G,T,C

* Why are the building block important for the taste?
  * Different use of building blocks in the DNA of yeast, mean that the blueprint will be different. If we can read the chain of the blocks, we can find which parts of the blueprint are actually changed.

* Can we read the building block and if yes how?
  * The chain of building blocks, also known as sequence can be read by seqeuencing.
  * You will learn how to do that in the next hours. 

* I am here to hear about beer but is this important elsewere?
  * The blueprints of your cells are also based on DNA, knowning your DNA sequence can be relevant for your health.
